I am the co-founder and CTO of [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev), the most widely adopted open-source LLM security tool. We help teams discover and eliminate LLM risks through automated red-teaming and vulnerability analysis. Before Promptfoo, I was the VP of Engineering at [Smile ID](https://usesmileid.com), where I led teams building identity verification APIs that now process hundreds of millions of checks across Africa. I also co-founded [Arthena](https://arthena.com) (acquired by Masterworks) and [Matroid](https://matroid.com).

In my spare time, I enjoy investing in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz), focusing on projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel free to get in touch.
